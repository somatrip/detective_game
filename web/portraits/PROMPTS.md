## 1. Detective Lila Chen (`lila-chen/`)

### neutral
```
Digital painting portrait, western graphic novel style, painterly brushwork, semi-realistic. Bust-up composition showing head, neck, shoulders, and upper chest.

Character: Detective Lila Chen — a lead homicide detective. East Asian woman, mid-30s. Sharp angular face with high cheekbones and a strong jawline. Dark brown penetrating eyes. Black hair pulled back in a practical low bun with a few deliberate strands framing her face. Lean build. Minimal makeup — concealer and a neutral lip. Warm olive skin tone. A faint scar at the outer edge of her left eyebrow.

Wearing a dark charcoal blazer over a slate-blue blouse with the collar open at the throat. A CPD detective badge visible on a lanyard at her chest. Small silver stud earrings. The blazer is sharply tailored — projecting authority, not allure.

Expression: NEUTRAL — Calm, evaluating focus. Steady gaze directed forward, lips in a firm straight line, one eyebrow very slightly higher than the other as if perpetually assessing. She looks composed and in control.

Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting: cool blue-white key light from upper-left, warm amber-gold fill from lower-right. Deep shadows on the unlit side of the face. Abstract dark navy-to-black gradient background with subtle cyan and gold bokeh circles suggesting out-of-focus gala lights. Stylized, attractive, confident character design. Dark noir palette with warm skin tones.

CPD detective badge on a lanyard at her chest. Dark charcoal blazer over a slate-blue blouse.

Expression: GUARDED — Her jaw tightens almost imperceptibly. Her gaze drops slightly to the side before returning forward. One hand rises near the lanyard at her chest. Controlled discomfort — she is too professional to look obviously evasive, but something is off. Subtle tension in the brow and the corners of her mouth.

Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting: cool blue-white key light from upper-left, warm amber-gold fill from lower-right. Deep shadows. Abstract dark navy-to-black gradient background with subtle cyan and gold bokeh. Stylized, attractive, confident character. Dark noir palette with warm skin tones.

Black hair in a practical low bun with framing strands. Warm olive skin. Faint scar at left eyebrow. CPD badge on lanyard. Dark charcoal blazer over slate-blue blouse.

Expression: DISTRESSED — Rare and reserved emotion. A deepening of the lines around her mouth, brows drawing together with genuine concern. Eyes showing gravity and weight — not panic, not tears, but the look of someone who understands the seriousness of what she's hearing. Lips pressed tightly together.

Black hair in a practical low bun with framing strands. Warm olive skin. Faint scar at left eyebrow. CPD badge on lanyard. Dark charcoal blazer over slate-blue blouse.

Expression: ANGRY — Ice-cold fury. Her eyes narrow sharply, jaw locks forward, chin drops slightly. This is quiet, dangerous anger — a prosecutor's lethal stare, not a shout. Her gaze is direct and unflinching, lips pressed into a thin hard line. The anger is controlled and devastating.

Expression: CONTEMPLATIVE — Head tilted very slightly to one side, eyes unfocused at mid-distance, lips slightly parted as she processes information. The analytical engine running. Her brow is relaxed, expression softened from its usual intensity. She is deep in thought, piecing together evidence.

Expression: SMIRKING — One corner of her mouth lifts in a dry, knowing half-smile. Her eyes warm slightly, a glint of wry humor surfacing. This is as close to warmth as she shows on duty — sardonic amusement at something clever. Head level, gaze direct but with the faintest sparkle.

## 2. Amelia Reyes (`amelia-reyes/`)

### neutral
```
Digital painting portrait, western graphic novel style, painterly brushwork, semi-realistic. Bust-up composition showing head, neck, shoulders, and upper chest.

Character: Amelia Reyes — Head Engineer at a tech company. Latina woman, late 30s. Round, intelligent face with dark circles under her large brown eyes — she is visibly exhausted. Wavy dark brown hair that was styled for a gala but is now falling out of its clip, loose strands catching the light. Full lips, strong nose. Warm brown skin with an undertone of gray from fatigue. Glasses pushed up on top of her head (she forgets they're there).

Wearing a jewel-toned teal cocktail dress with a cream-colored oversized cardigan thrown over it — the look of someone who stopped caring about appearances hours ago. A thin gold chain necklace with a small geometric company pin. A smartwatch on her wrist.

Expression: NEUTRAL — Tired but alert. Slight furrowing of her brow, eyes a bit too wide — running on caffeine and adrenaline. Lips pressed together in a tense line. She looks like she is holding things together by sheer force of will.

Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting: cool blue-white key light from upper-left, warm amber-gold fill from lower-right. Deep shadows. Abstract dark navy-to-black gradient background with subtle cyan and gold bokeh. Stylized, attractive character. Dark noir palette with warm skin tones.

Expression: GUARDED — One hand comes up defensively near her shoulder. Her eyes dart to the side, avoiding direct contact. Her body language screams "I don't want to discuss this." Brow creases deepen. She looks like she's about to launch into a technical deflection.

Expression: DISTRESSED — The mask cracks. Her eyes well with tears, brows crumple upward in the classic grief expression. She looks down and to the right, mouth trembling slightly. She is terrified — the weight of blame and guilt is crushing her. Genuinely overwhelmed.

Expression: ANGRY — Defensive anger blazes. Her jaw juts forward, eyes blaze with indignation. This is the fierce pride of a brilliant engineer whose competence is being questioned by people who don't understand her work. Brows drawn down hard, nostrils slightly flared, chin lifted.

Expression: CONTEMPLATIVE — Exhaustion softens into genuine reflection. Her eyes are half-closed, head tilting slightly, the weight of ethical conflict visible in her expression. The tension in her face has eased. She looks like someone wrestling with a moral question, not defending herself.

Expression: SMIRKING — A tight, bitter half-smile. Not humor — weary irony. One corner of her mouth lifts while her eyes stay tired and knowing. "You have no idea what I've been through." It's the expression of someone who finds the absurdity of their situation darkly amusing.

## 3. Noah Sterling (`noah-sterling/`)

### neutral
```
Digital painting portrait, western graphic novel style, painterly brushwork, semi-realistic. Bust-up composition showing head, neck, shoulders, and upper chest.

Character: Noah Sterling — Co-Founder and COO of a tech company. White man, early 40s. Classically handsome with sharp, photogenic features: strong jaw, straight nose, blue-gray eyes. Sandy brown hair swept back with product — not a strand out of place. Light stubble that looks deliberately maintained. Athletic build visible in broad shoulders. Perfect teeth. His attractiveness has a practiced, intentional quality — every angle feels like a magazine cover.

Wearing an impeccably tailored midnight navy suit with a subtle blue sheen. White dress shirt open at the collar — no tie, calculated casual. Antique gold cufflinks catching the light. A pale gold pocket square. An expensive watch.

Expression: NEUTRAL — The media smile. Perfect composure, warm eyes, a slight upward curve of the lips. He looks trustworthy, approachable, and in total control. This mask is utterly convincing — the viewer should feel charmed.

Character: Noah Sterling — COO. White man, early 40s. Classically handsome, strong jaw, blue-gray eyes, sandy brown hair swept back perfectly. Deliberate stubble. Midnight navy suit, white shirt open at collar, antique gold cufflinks, gold pocket square.

Expression: GUARDED — The smile tightens. His eyes stay warm but the jaw clenches microscopically. He subtly shifts his posture backward. One hand adjusts a cufflink — a nervous tell he doesn't realize he has. The charm is still there but it's costing him effort to maintain. Something beneath the surface.

Expression: DISTRESSED — The facade slips completely. His eyes go wide, color drains from his polished composure. A sheen of sweat at the temples. Mouth opens slightly in shock. This should feel shocking in contrast to how composed he normally appears — the mask has cracked and the real person underneath is frightened.

Expression: ANGRY — Cold fury. The charm vanishes entirely. His eyes go flat and predatory, jaw thrusts forward, lips thin into a hard line. He looks dangerous for the first time. This is the face of a man capable of murder — calculating, ruthless, the pretense of warmth completely gone. Menacing intensity.

Expression: CONTEMPLATIVE — A performance of thoughtfulness. He touches his chin, looks slightly upward, brow furrowed in "concern." Unlike genuine contemplation, this feels rehearsed and practiced — the kind of expression someone makes when they want to appear empathetic for cameras. Calculated vulnerability.

Character: Celeste Ward — an award-winning jazz vocalist. Black woman, early 30s. Strikingly beautiful with high cheekbones, deep brown skin, and large expressive dark eyes lined with gold eyeliner. Full lips in a deep berry color. Natural hair styled in an elegant updo with golden pins, a few loose coils framing her face. Long graceful neck accentuated by her posture. Prominent collarbones with a subtle gold shimmer.

Wearing a deep wine/burgundy velvet gown with a plunging neckline — elegant and sensual. A statement gold cuff bracelet on her upper arm. Delicate gold chain earrings. She is dressed for the stage and she knows it.

Expression: NEUTRAL — Poised mystique. Chin slightly raised, eyes half-lidded with a Mona Lisa quality. She looks like she's listening to music only she can hear. Remote but utterly captivating. An aura of quiet magnetism.

Expression: GUARDED — Her chin drops, eyes look away and down. The mystique transforms into a shield. Lips press together. She withdraws into herself — not aggressive defense, but graceful retreat. She is protecting her grief and the memory of someone she loved. Vulnerability hidden behind composure.

Expression: DISTRESSED — Devastating vulnerability. Her eyes glisten with unshed tears, the composed facade fractures beautifully. One hand moves toward her throat.

Expression: ANGRY — Quiet, burning intensity. Her eyes lock forward with ferocity, nostrils flare slightly, jaw tightens. She does not yell — she pierces. Her gaze is devastating in its focus. The beauty becomes weaponized — intimidating in its directness. A performer's command turned to rage.

Expression: CONTEMPLATIVE — The most beautiful expression. Eyes distant and unfocused, head tilted slightly, light catching the gold eyeliner.

## 5. Gideon Holt (`gideon-holt/`)

### neutral

Digital painting portrait, western graphic novel style, painterly brushwork, semi-realistic. Bust-up composition showing head, neck, shoulders, and upper chest.

Character: Gideon Holt — Security Director, former Army intelligence officer. White man, late 40s. Military bearing with rigid posture, square shoulders, and a thick neck. Rugged, weathered face: deep-set blue eyes under heavy brows, a strong nose that has been broken once, squared jaw with permanent five o'clock shadow. Short-cropped gray-streaked dark hair in a high-and-tight military cut. A thin scar on his right cheekbone.

Wearing a black tactical-adjacent suit fitted for movement. Black dress shirt buttoned to the top with no tie. An earpiece in his right ear for security communications. A security credential badge on a retractable clip. Matte black military-style watch. Everything is subdued, functional, deliberately un-flashy.

Expression: NEUTRAL — Rigid alertness. Jaw set, eyes scanning, expression flat and unreadable. He looks like he is evaluating threats at all times. Not hostile, but not welcoming either. A wall of professional composure.

Gray-streaked high-and-tight hair. Scar on right cheekbone. Black tactical suit, black shirt buttoned to top, earpiece, security badge.

Expression: GUARDED — Almost identical to neutral — this is a man trained to not show tells. The only change: his eyes fix on a single point and stop scanning. His breathing becomes controlled and measured. The jaw tightens almost imperceptibly. The deliberate stillness IS the tell. A trained operative maintaining composure under pressure.

Expression: DISTRESSED — The military mask cracks with visible effort. A tightening around the eyes, a vein visible in his temple. He swallows hard. His distress looks like suppressed rage mixed with the calculation of a cornered animal. Not weakness — barely-contained alarm behind rigid discipline.

Expression: ANGRY — Controlled menace. He leans forward at the shoulders, chin drops, eyes look up from under his heavy brow — the "you're testing me" look. Jaw muscles visibly clench. He does not explode — he pressurizes. The threat is implied, not performed. Military-grade intimidation.

Expression: SMIRKING — A grim, humorless twitch of the mouth. Not amusement — contempt. "I've faced worse than you, detective." His smirk is a challenge, a display of dominance from someone who has operated in far more dangerous environments. Eyes hard and knowing.

Character: Dr. Mira Kline — Ethicist Consultant with a PhD in Bioethics. White woman, mid-40s. Intellectual beauty — striking in a quiet, refined way. Angular face with prominent cheekbones, pale green eyes behind wire-rimmed rectangular glasses. Light brown hair with gray streaks worn in a precise French twist. Thin lips, narrow nose. Slender build with elegant posture — cerebral, not theatrical.

Wearing a structured dove-gray blazer over a high-necked black silk blouse. A silver geometric pendant necklace — her one aesthetic indulgence. Small pearl stud earrings. Glasses always present. The outfit is expensive but restrained.

Expression: NEUTRAL — Measured assessment. Eyes steady behind her glasses, brow slightly raised as if waiting for the other person to finish making their point. Lips in a thin line. She radiates quiet academic authority and intellectual precision.

Expression: GUARDED — One hand rises to adjust her glasses — her nervous tell. Eyes drop to the right. She straightens in her posture, becoming more formal, more precise. Her "guarded" is increased formality, as if retreating behind academic language and protocol. Controlled discomfort masked by professionalism.

Expression: DISTRESSED — Guilt surfaces. Her composure doesn't crack so much as slowly sag. Eyes lower behind the glasses, brow furrows deeply, mouth tightens. She looks like someone confronting the full weight of a moral failure — not panicked, but deeply burdened. The face of someone who knows they failed their own principles.

Digital painting portrait, western graphic novel style, painterly brushwork, semi-realistic. Bust-up composition.

Character: Dr. Mira Kline — Ethicist Consultant. White woman, mid-40s. Angular face, pale green eyes behind wire-rimmed rectangular glasses. Light brown hair with gray streaks in French twist. Dove-gray blazer over high-necked black silk blouse. Silver geometric pendant. Pearl studs.

Expression: ANGRY — Righteous indignation. Her eyes flash behind her glasses, jaw sets firmly, chin lifts with authority. This is the anger of someone who has been intellectually wronged — her ethics work exploited, her recommendations twisted. Sharp, principled fury. Her glasses seem to magnify the intensity of her gaze.

Expression: CONTEMPLATIVE — Her most authentic expression. Eyes focused at mid-distance through her glasses, brow slightly knit, one hand touching the geometric silver pendant unconsciously. She is genuinely working through an ethical calculus — weighing competing moral obligations. Deep, honest thought. This is who she really is beneath the professional armor.

Expression: SMIRKING — Dry academic superiority. A subtle, closed-mouth smile with slight eye-narrowing. "I've published on this topic." The faintest suggestion of intellectual condescension — she knows something the detective does not, and it shows in the quiet confidence of her expression.

## 7. Eddie Voss (`eddie-voss/`)

Digital painting portrait, western graphic novel style, painterly brushwork, semi-realistic. Bust-up composition showing head, neck, shoulders, and upper chest.

Character: Eddie Voss — a house bartender at a high-end venue. White man, late 20s. Boyishly handsome with an edge — the kind of face that gets good tips. Messy dark auburn hair pushed back but falling forward. A dusting of freckles across the bridge of his nose and cheeks. Bright hazel-green eyes that are always watching, always noticing. Strong brow, slight cleft in his chin. Lean build.

Wearing a fitted black vest over a white dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up to his forearms, showing lean sinewy arms. A black bow tie, slightly loosened. A bar towel draped over his left shoulder — he forgot it's there. A thin leather cord bracelet on one wrist.

Expression: NEUTRAL — Wry awareness. His default half-smirk, one eyebrow slightly raised, hazel-green eyes bright and alert. He looks like he's about to say something sardonic. Permanently amused by the human condition. The face of someone who's overheard a thousand secrets.

Expression: GUARDED — The humor drains from his face. His eyes widen, the habitual half-smirk freezes into a tight-lipped mask. One hand fiddles with the bar towel on his shoulder. His physical tells betray him — nervous energy visible in his posture even in a bust portrait. The wry confidence is gone.

Expression: DISTRESSED — Wide-eyed anxiety. He looks young and scared under the wry exterior. Brows raised high, mouth slightly open, the sardonic confidence has completely evaporated. The freckles and youthful face make him look vulnerable. He is genuinely afraid of the consequences of what he's done.

Expression: ANGRY — Not real anger — defensive sarcasm. An exaggerated eye-roll, head tilting back, mouth twisting in disbelief. "Oh, so NOW I'm the bad guy?" He deflects with attitude rather than confrontation. The anger of someone who feels cornered but fights with wit, not fists.

Expression: CONTEMPLATIVE — Rare sincerity. The smirk fades completely, his eyes soften, he looks slightly downward. The freckles and youthful face make him look vulnerable in this moment of honesty. He's weighing loyalty against self-preservation. For once, he's not performing.

Expression: SMIRKING — Maximum intensity of his natural state. A full crooked grin, eyes gleaming with mischief, head cocked to one side. This is "let me tell you something interesting" bartender gossip mode. He's about to share a secret he probably shouldn't, and he's enjoying every second of it. Infectious energy.

## 8. Priya Shah (`priya-shah/`)

Digital painting portrait, western graphic novel style, painterly brushwork, semi-realistic. Bust-up composition showing head, neck, shoulders, and upper chest.

Character: Priya Shah — an investigative journalist for a major newspaper. South Asian woman, early 30s. Sharp, arresting features: dark intelligent eyes with thick expressive brows. Strong nose, defined jawline, full lips. Long black hair in a sleek side-parted style falling over one shoulder. Bronze-brown skin. She has the alert, kinetic energy of someone who is always working an angle. Athletic, compact build with squared shoulders — she physically takes up space with confidence.

Wearing a fitted deep emerald blazer over a black silk camisole. Thin gold hoop earrings and a simple gold chain. A press lanyard/badge tucked into her blazer pocket with just the cord visible. A leather crossbody bag strap visible across her chest.

Expression: NEUTRAL — Investigative sharpness. Eyes slightly narrowed in permanent assessment, lips set, chin slightly forward. She looks like she's already forming her next question before you've finished answering the current one. Confident, engaged, watchful. A predator's stillness.

Expression: GUARDED — Journalistic stonewalling. Her expression goes deliberately, almost aggressively neutral. Arms crossed at the shoulder level. "I'm protecting my sources" is written on every line of her face. Eyes steady and unblinking, daring the detective to push harder. She has done this before.

Expression: DISTRESSED — She doesn't do distressed easily. Her version is frustrated concern — brow deeply knit, jaw tight, eyes darting as she processes implications. Not fear — urgent calculation. She's worried about the story, her sources, the ethical implications of what she knows. The tension of someone who holds dangerous information.

Expression: ANGRY — Confrontational indignation. Her chin lifts, eyes widen and lock forward with intensity, one hand rises in a "stop" gesture near her shoulder. "You don't get to intimidate the press." Her anger has the righteous quality of someone defending institutional principles, not personal ego. Fierce and formidable.

Expression: CONTEMPLATIVE — The journalist weighing publication ethics. Eyes go distant, one hand unconsciously touches the crossbody strap. She's deciding whether the public interest outweighs source protection. The sharp edges of her usual expression soften into genuine moral consideration. Still sharp — but turned inward.

## 9. Marcus Vale (`marcus-vale/`)

Digital painting portrait, western graphic novel style, painterly brushwork, semi-realistic. Bust-up composition showing head, neck, shoulders, and upper chest.

Character: Marcus Vale — a freelance stage manager. Black man, mid-30s. Athletic build with squared shoulders. Close-cropped fade haircut, neatly shaped. Warm brown skin, round face with a broad forehead. Expressive dark brown eyes that move quickly, tracking multiple things at once. Clean-shaven with strong eyebrows. His face is naturally warm and open when not stressed — but he's always stressed tonight. A slight sheen of sweat on his forehead.

Wearing all black stage crew attire: a fitted black button-up shirt with the top button open, black slacks. A black utility belt visible at the waist with a radio and a multi-tool. A headset hanging around his neck — not on his ears, the show is over. A tablet stylus tucked behind his right ear.

Expression: NEUTRAL — Stressed professionalism. Brow slightly furrowed, eyes alert and darting, mouth set in a tense line. He looks like he's mentally running through a checklist even while standing still. Not hostile — just perpetually busy and overwhelmed.

Expression: GUARDED — Physical tension radiates. Shoulders rise toward his ears, jaw locks, eyes fix straight forward. One hand grips the headset around his neck like a lifeline. He is terrified of being caught for what he's done but desperately trying to hide it behind "I'm just the tech guy." Rigid and barely holding it together.

Expression: DISTRESSED — Open, undisguised stress. Brow deeply creased, eyes wide with alarm, sweat visible on his forehead and temples. He looks like a man watching a disaster unfold that he caused. One hand at his temple or rubbing the back of his neck. The facade of calm has completely collapsed.

Expression: ANGRY — Frustrated outburst. His mouth opens, brows slam down, head shakes in disbelief. "I'm just the stage manager!" The anger of someone being held responsible for something far bigger than their role. He feels used, manipulated, and cornered. His anger is defensive — a scared man lashing out.

Expression: CONTEMPLATIVE — Exhausted honesty. His face relaxes from its perpetual tension for the first time, eyes soften, the furrow in his brow eases. He looks tired — genuinely, deeply tired.
