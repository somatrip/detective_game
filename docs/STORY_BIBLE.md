## The Setting: Lyric Atrium Hotel

The Lyric Atrium Hotel is a refurbished 1920s art deco landmark. Originally a grand jazz-era hotel, it fell into disrepair until Julian Mercer's holding company funded its restoration, giving Mercer a majority ownership stake. The renovation preserved the hotel's period character: brass fixtures, geometric tile work, chevron moldings, and a soaring central atrium. Mercer's investment is why the Panopticon gala was hosted here — and why he had the authority to negotiate a sale of the property.

### Basement Level (B1) — Service & Maintenance

| Location | Code | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Maintenance Room** | — | Houses the main electrical breaker panel, HVAC controls, and plumbing manifolds. Access requires a **physical maintenance-room key** (not a keycard) held exclusively by the Head Engineer. The Head Engineer also carries an **engineering keycard** (ENGR-0001) that grants staff-level electronic access to the service elevator, freight elevator, rooftop stairwell, and restricted service areas. Both items live on the Head Engineer's work lanyard. A single steel door opens from the Utility Corridor. Lockpick marks were found on this door after the murder. |
| **Utility Corridor** | UTIL-CORR | Runs the length of the basement connecting the maintenance room, storage areas, and the service elevator shaft. Dimly lit even under normal power; emergency lighting barely reaches here. |
| **Service Elevator** | SVC-ELEV | A freight-sized elevator connecting B1 to every floor up to the rooftop. Used by staff for deliveries and equipment. Keycard required. |
| **Incinerator Room** | — | Adjacent to the maintenance room. Contains the hotel's gas-fed legacy incinerator (manual pilot ignition; does not require electrical power), now used for secure document destruction. The burned notebook fragment was recovered here. |
| **Staff Locker Room & Break Area** | — | Staff facilities. |

### Ground Floor (1F) — Public Spaces

| Location | Code | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Main Lobby** | LOBBY-MAIN | Grand double-height entrance with original terrazzo floors, an art deco reception desk, and a restored brass-cage elevator. Opens directly into the central atrium. |
| **Staff Entrance** | LOBBY-STAFF | Side door used by employees, accessible from the alley. Keycard required. |
| **The Atrium** | — | A five-story open-air interior courtyard at the hotel's center. A geometric glass skylight crowns the top. Balconied mezzanines on each floor overlook the ground-level garden court below. During the gala, decorated with vintage microphones and projected surveillance-art installations referencing Panopticon's themes. |
| **Kitchen & Prep Area** | KITCHEN | Serves both the ballroom and the VIP bar. Connected to the ballroom service corridor. |
| **Atrium Stairwell** | ATRIUM-STAIR | A grand open staircase winding up through the central atrium, with landings on each mezzanine level from the ground floor to the 7th floor. Visible from the balconied mezzanines. During the blackout, this was the main route between floors for anyone avoiding the elevators. |

### Second Floor (2F) — Event Spaces

| Location | Code | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Grand Ballroom** | BALL-MAIN | The primary gala venue. Seats 200 guests. A raised stage at the north end was used for the Panopticon keynote demo and speeches. The Ballroom Service Corridor (BALL-SVC) runs along the south wall, linking the kitchen to the ballroom for catering. |
| **Backstage Area** | BSTAGE | Dressing rooms, a lighting/sound console operated by the stage manager, green room, and a corridor leading to the service elevator and freight elevator. |
| **Speakeasy Lounge** | SPEAK-LOUNGE | An intimate, low-ceilinged jazz club styled after a 1920s speakeasy. Located off the atrium mezzanine on the second floor. Celeste Ward performed here. A small stage, cocktail tables, and a secondary bar. |
| **VIP Bar & Lounge** | VIP-BAR | An exclusive bar adjacent to the speakeasy, tended by Eddie Voss during the gala. Separated by a velvet rope. Mercer spent time here during the evening. |

### Third Floor (3F) — Conference & Library

| Location | Code | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Hotel Library** | LIBR-MAIN | A wood-paneled reading room with leather armchairs and floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. Dr. Mira Kline hosted her ethics roundtable here. A private study room in the back can be reserved. |
| **Conference Room 2** | CONF-2 | A smaller meeting room used for private conversations and press briefings during the gala. |
| **Security Command Center** | CMD-CTR | The nerve center for hotel surveillance. Banks of monitors display feeds from CCTV cameras throughout the property. Gideon Holt's base of operations. Located in a restricted wing of the third floor with reinforced door and keycard access. |

### Floors 4–6 — Guest Rooms

Standard guest rooms. Not directly relevant to the case.

### Floor 7 (7F) — VIP Suites

| Location | Code | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Guest Floor 7** | GUEST-7F | Premium suites reserved for gala VIPs. Julian Mercer occupied **Suite 701**; Noah Sterling occupied **Suite 703**. Each suite has a private balcony overlooking the atrium skylight. Keycard access required for the floor. |

### Rooftop (8F) — Observatory & Access

| Location | Code | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Rooftop Observatory** | ROOF-OBS | A glass-enclosed observation deck with panoramic city views. Contains a collection of antique astronomical instruments, including the **telescope mount** used as the murder weapon. The telescope mount was a brass and iron Victorian-era piece weighing approximately 8 kg, displayed on a mahogany pedestal. It sat in a shallow brass cradle — secured by its own weight, no bolts — and could be lifted with one hand. Mercer's body was found here at approximately 11:44 PM by Security Director Gideon Holt. |
| **Rooftop Stairwell** | ROOF-STAIR | An enclosed staircase connecting the 7th floor to the rooftop. Keycard-controlled fire door at the top. |
| **Freight Elevator** | FRT-ELEV | A large cargo elevator with stops at B1, 1F, 2F, and the rooftop. Keycard required. Noah was seen near this elevator by Priya Shah before the blackout. |

### Security & Surveillance

- **CCTV cameras** cover: the lobby, ballroom entrances, elevator lobbies on each floor, the rooftop stairwell door, and the command center corridor.
- **Cameras do NOT cover:** the interior of guest rooms, the speakeasy lounge interior, the backstage area, the maintenance room, or the utility corridor in B1.
- **Keycard readers** are installed at every zone transition point. They log card ID, holder name, zone, direction (entry/exit), and timestamp.
- **During the power outage (11:15–11:30 PM):** ALL keycard readers went offline. The backup generator failed to engage primary access control, meaning doors with electronic locks defaulted to **unlocked** during the outage. Physical-key locks (e.g., the maintenance room) remained locked.
- **Tailgating:** Keycard readers log only the card swiped, not the number of people who pass through the door. Multiple people can enter on a single swipe. The logs prove a card was used at a time and place, but do not prove the cardholder was the only person who entered — or even that the cardholder was the one who swiped.
- **Panopticon Demo:** Mercer's keynote included a live demo of the Panopticon surveillance platform, which briefly accessed the hotel's own CCTV feeds to show real-time facial recognition and behavioral analytics.

### Key Routes During the Blackout

1. Backstage (2F) → Service elevator → B1 Utility Corridor → Maintenance room (if they had the physical key)
2. Backstage (2F) → Freight elevator → Rooftop
3. VIP Bar (2F) → Main corridor → Atrium stairs → 7F → Rooftop stairwell
4. Library (3F) → Main corridor → Atrium stairs → up or down
5. Any floor → Service elevator → any other floor (no keycard needed during outage)

During the 15-minute blackout, electronic locks were unlocked, so movement between zones left **no keycard trace**.

### 2. Amelia Reyes — Head Engineer

| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Head Engineer of the Lyric Atrium Hotel |
| **Gender** | Female |
| **Archetype** | Professional Fixer |
| **Voice** | Shimmer |
| **Personality** | Precise, prideful, loyal to hotel heritage, dislikes Mercer's modernization plans. Talks like someone who's been fixing things her whole life — practical, a little impatient, not fancy. |

**Public Story:**
- Was calibrating server racks in the ballroom when the power outage occurred
- Insists her maintenance-room key and engineering keycard never left her possession
- Sees Mercer as a threat to the hotel's legacy

**Hidden Truth:**
- Lent her work lanyard — which holds both her physical maintenance-room key and her engineering keycard (ENGR-0001) — to Eddie Voss (~6:30 PM) so he could retrieve a misplaced toolkit
- After discovering documents showing Mercer intended to sell the hotel to a developer (8:36 PM maintenance visit), she planned to search Mercer's suite for proof
- **Pulled the breaker** at 11:15 PM to cause the blackout, then searched Suite 701 during the outage
- Had to pick the lock on the maintenance door because her key was still with Eddie
- Did NOT kill Mercer
- Fears losing her position if the key and keycard loan is exposed

**Where Her Story Breaks:**
- Key and keycard loan to Eddie contradicts claim of exclusive possession
- Lockpick marks on maintenance door
- Keycard shows ballroom entry at 11:32 PM (after power restored, not during outage as claimed)
- Hotel sale documents provide motive for the blackout

### 3. Noah Sterling — Co-Founder (THE MURDERER)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Role** | Co-Founder of Panopticon |
| **Gender** | Male |
| **Archetype** | Proud Executive |
| **Voice** | Onyx |
| **Personality** | Smooth, charming, used to talking his way out of things. Under the surface he's desperate — debt, a looming board vote. Keep it breezy. |

**Public Story (Cover Story / Lies):**
- Claims he was on stage delivering a keynote demo when the outage hit
- Says he stayed with the guests to calm them during the blackout
- Presents himself as loyal to Mercer and shocked by his death
- Claims conversation with Mercer at VIP bar was "friendly"
- Claims he never went to the service levels or basement
- Claims he never obtained any maintenance keys or keycards

**Hidden Truth (What Actually Happened):**
- Embezzled company funds to cover gambling debts
- Mercer discovered the embezzlement and scheduled a surprise board vote to remove him
- Pressured Eddie Voss into giving him Amelia's engineering keycard (ENGR-0001) and physical maintenance-room key at the VIP bar around 10:40 PM
- During the blackout, used the engineering keycard to reach the rooftop observatory
- **Killed Mercer** by striking him with the antique telescope mount (~11:20 PM)
- Antique machine oil from the telescope mount transferred to his cufflinks (he did not notice)
- Took Mercer's notebook containing the blackmail list and board vote evidence
- Descended via rooftop stairwell to 7th floor, then took the atrium stairwell down (Celeste Ward saw him passing the 2nd-floor mezzanine at ~11:23 PM). Continued to B1 and fed the notebook pages into the incinerator (burn was incomplete; a fragment survived)
- Made his way back to the ballroom to be seen by other guests

**Where His Lies Break:**
1. "I remained backstage/ballroom" — Keycard logs show ENGR-0001 at freight elevator (11:09 PM), service elevator B1 (11:13 PM), utility corridor exit (11:31 PM)
2. "Conversation with Mercer was friendly" — Eddie Voss and other witnesses describe tension
3. "Never went to service levels" — Keycard log 11:31 PM: ENGR-0001 exiting Utility Corridor B1
4. "Never obtained any keys or keycards" — Eddie Voss testimony, keycard ENGR-0001 chain of custody
5. "Shocked by Mercer's death" — Board vote motive, embezzlement evidence, encrypted schedule

**Progression Under Pressure:**
Deny everything → Explain away keycard logs as "got lost" → Deny key → Admit "disagreements" with Mercer → Claim self-defense or accident

| **Mira's Rendezvous** | Contradicts her roundtable alibi; library attendees note she slipped away |

---

## Solution & Resolution

**Murderer:** Noah Sterling

**Motive:** Prevent public ousting and loss of fortune; secure control of Panopticon by eliminating Mercer.

**Method:** During the blackout, Noah used the engineering keycard ENGR-0001 (obtained from Eddie, who got it from Amelia's work lanyard) to reach the rooftop via the service elevator. He confronted Mercer about the embezzlement and the board vote. When Mercer refused to back down, Noah grabbed the antique telescope mount and struck him. He then took Mercer's notebook and attempted to destroy it in the basement incinerator.

**Physical Evidence:**
- Antique machine oil on Noah's cufflinks (matches telescope mount)
- Burned notebook fragment in incinerator (incomplete burn)
- Keycard ENGR-0001 logs (registered to A. Reyes) placing Noah in freight elevator (11:09 PM), service elevator B1 (11:13 PM), and utility corridor B1 (11:31 PM)

**Witness Evidence:**
- Celeste Ward saw Noah descending the atrium stairwell during the blackout, agitated and adjusting his cuffs
- Priya Shah saw Noah near the freight elevator before the blackout
- Gideon Holt saw Noah on B1 elevator lobby camera entering the service elevator lobby
- Eddie Voss can confirm he gave Noah the engineering keycard and maintenance-room key
- Marcus Vale's cue sheet shows Noah's 5-minute (30-minute total) absence

**Motive Evidence:**
- Encrypted schedule reveals surprise board vote to oust Noah
- Financial records show embezzlement to cover gambling debts

### Player Success Conditions
- Present combined evidence: key/keycard loan + oil residue + Celeste's testimony + board vote motive
- Maintain legal interrogation tactics (no unlawful threats) to keep score high
- Accuse Noah only after all contradictions are resolved to avoid penalties

## Case Briefing (Player Entry Log)

> **Victim:** Julian Mercer, charismatic venture capitalist, majority owner of the Lyric Atrium Hotel, and CEO of the Panopticon surveillance startup — found dead in the hotel's rooftop observatory.
>
> **Estimated Time of Death:** Between 11:15 and 11:30 PM (during the power outage). The victim was bludgeoned with an antique telescope mount.
>
> **Body Discovered:** Approximately 11:44 PM by Security Director Gideon Holt in the rooftop observatory, during an exclusive tech-meets-jazz gala at the historic 1920s art deco hotel.
>
> **Circumstances:** A power outage struck between 11:15 and 11:30 PM — the breaker was pulled manually. Stormy weather delayed police arrival, giving suspects time to coordinate alibis.
>
> **Initial Evidence:** Forensics recovered a burned notebook fragment and traces of antique machine oil near the body. Hotel security has also provided keycard access logs for the rooftop. Use these to press suspects during interrogation.
>
> **Your Role:** You are the lead detective. Interrogate eight persons of interest — each with their own secrets, motives, and knowledge boundaries. Uncover contradictions, gather evidence, and identify the killer.

## Interrogation Mechanics

### NPC Archetypes

| Archetype | NPCs | Pressure Scale | Rapport Scale | Pressure Decay | Rapport Decay | Contradiction Bonus | Empathy Bonus |
|-----------|-------|---------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Proud Executive** | Noah Sterling, Dr. Mira Kline | 0.8 | 0.7 | 1.5 | 0.5 | 8.0 | 3.0 |
| **Anxious Insider** | Celeste Ward, Eddie Voss, Marcus Vale | 1.3 | 1.2 | 0.5 | 1.0 | 5.0 | 10.0 |
| **Professional Fixer** | Lila Chen, Amelia Reyes, Gideon Holt, Priya Shah | 0.9 | 0.8 | 2.0 | 0.5 | 10.0 | 4.0 |

### Pressure Bands

| Band | Range | Behavioral Guidance |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| **Calm** | 0–24 | Relaxed. Answers easily, maybe even a little dismissive — this doesn't faze you. |
| **Tense** | 25–49 | Getting uncomfortable. Keep it together but let cracks show — shorter answers, deflections. |
| **Shaken** | 50–74 | Rattled. Trip over words, lose train of thought, may say something unintended. |
| **Cornered** | 75–100 | Desperate. Snap at the detective, blurt things out, give ground not normally given. |

### Rapport Bands

| Band | Range | Behavioral Guidance |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| **Cold** | 0–24 | Don't trust this detective at all. Give as little as possible. One-word answers fine. |
| **Neutral** | 25–49 | Cooperating, barely. Answer what's asked but don't offer anything extra. |
| **Open** | 50–74 | Warming up. Share more freely — still careful, but willing to talk. |
| **Trusting** | 75–100 | Trust this detective. Say things you'd normally keep to yourself. |

### Interrogation Tactics

| Tactic | Pressure Delta | Rapport Delta |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Open Ended | +3 | +5 |
| Specific Factual | +8 | +2 |
| Empathy | -6 | +15 |
| Present Evidence | +15 | +0 |
| Point Out Contradiction | +22 | -7 |
| Direct Accusation | +28 | -12 |
| Repeat Pressure | +12 | -4 |
| Topic Change | -10 | +4 |

### Evidence Strength Multipliers

| Strength | Multiplier (on pressure delta) |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| None | 1.0x |
| Weak | 1.4x |
| Strong | 2.0x |
| Smoking Gun | 3.0x |

### Accelerated Pressure Decay

When both conditions are true simultaneously, pressure decay is multiplied by **4x**:
1. The NPC's peak pressure has **never reached 75+** (never been "cornered")
2. The current turn's effective pressure delta is **<= 0** (empathy or topic change)

This makes pressure bleed away quickly if the player backs off before truly breaking the NPC, while preserving permanent psychological impact once cornered.

### NPC Expressions

NPCs display one of six expressions based on their emotional state during each response:
`neutral`, `guarded`, `distressed`, `angry`, `contemplative`, `smirking`
